This project will be a simple weather dashboard.

PROPOSED USE: Adding in the uncertainty of each weather station to a forecast.

weather-js will be used to pull live temperature data for a chosen city

User can select their city of interest.

Database data used is hourly weather data, and hourly weather predictions, for weather stations around Australia. Download can be found here:

There will be a visualisation of the max and minum temperature across the week, with some uncertainty based 
	on the historical uncertainty of stations in your region.

There will be a projection of the hourly temperature on that day, based on the historical hourly temp pattern for that day in your area.

There will also be a map of the uncertainty in weather station temperature across the globe.

The data processing and web scraping for this dashboard will be powered by Flask, Leaflet will be used for the mapping and Plotly for the charts
As the dataset is very large and in a tabular format, it will be loading into an SQL dataset.
If necessary, the jQuery and Underscore libraries will be used to make DOM manipulation and data processing easier.
